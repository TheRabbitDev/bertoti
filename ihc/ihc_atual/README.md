Recently microsoft added a new feature, the site asks you to verify your identity when you want to log in to the website, it would be a fine adition if it didn't break the Efficiency of Use, on microsoft teams you get loged out after sometime, so basicaly almost every day you need to log-in again which takes away the user's flexibility to stay logged in.
